# Power Relay Switcher

**Power Relay Switcher** is an electronic device consisting of **4 relays**, each of which is capable of switching loads of up to **20 A**, **240 V AC** or **28 V DC**. Each of the four relays can be **manually** closed/opened from the **front panel** or via **USB** using **SCPI** commands. 

The device was designed for the automation of running battery pack management unit learning cycles for batteries up to a capacity of 200 Ah. In that application it is to be used in conjunction with a power supply, an electronic load and a multimeter. These battery learning cycles require charging-resting-discharging-resting periods in excess of 24 hours which are cumbersome for an operator to manually manage having to connect and disconnect a power supply and an electronic load at the exact moments determined by the learning cycle.
